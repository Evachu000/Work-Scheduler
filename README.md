## Description

The Work-Day-Scheduler got a current date for the user to input their tasks for the day. Also, the time block for each 1-hour period is colour-coded. 

The task is easily put in and clear using save-button. All data is storage into the user's local storage. Therefore, the tasks will be persisted after SAVE.
